## **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
To streamline our development process, we use GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). This setup allows us to maintain high-quality code and deliver updates to users efficiently.

### **GitHub Actions Workflow Overview**
- **Automated Builds**: On each commit, the code is automatically built to ensure there are no compilation errors, providing immediate feedback to developers.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests are executed to validate that existing functionalities work as expected, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Automated Signing**: Our CI pipeline securely accesses a KeyStore file to sign the application, which is essential for releasing on Android and maintaining security standards.
- **Artifact Storage**: After building, the app's output files are uploaded as artifacts, making it easy for testers and contributors to download and review each build.

### **CI/CD Pipeline Details**
The GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) is configured to:
- Utilize environment secrets to securely store sensitive information like passwords and API keys, enhancing security.
- Build the app using Gradle, with environment variables to manage secure signing efficiently.
- Store build artifacts for easy access post-build, facilitating testing and distribution.
