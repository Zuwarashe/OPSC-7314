Instructions for Testing:
Before running the application, please note that an API key is required to successfully make requests to the Spoonacular API. In the ApiClient class, you will find a placeholder for the API_KEY. Testers must input a valid API key in the API_KEY constant before proceeding. 

available key : 2acf8c972dba47449275230ecdf43291

This key can also be obtained by signing up on the Spoonacular API platform. Once the key is in place, the app will be able to authenticate and retrieve recipe data as intended.
